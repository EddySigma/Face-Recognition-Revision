# Face-Recognition

Description: Face-Recognition is an open source project that is used to open up a webcam and detect the user's emotion. We then write an emoji over the face corresponding to the emotion detected. The git files can be imported into any python file.

Language and Libraries: This project was written in Python and we used the OpenCV library. This library can take advantage of multi-core processing.
